# Website_Data-AB_Test
AB testing, analysis, and visualization of simulated web traffic data for 2 landing pages of a news website

### Project Description:

The dataset contains information about the behavior of 100 users from 2 different landing pages. The data will be analyzed to determine which of the two landing page variants is more effective in converting users to subscribers. The dependence of conversion on the preferred language will also be analyzed in this project.

### Skills:

Hypothesis Testing, A/B testing, Data Visualization, Statistical Inference, Exploratory Data Analysis (Variable Identification, Univariate analysis, Bi-Variate analysis), Python
